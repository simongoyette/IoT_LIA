IoT LIA:

## What have I learned?
This project taught me a lot and although it was fairly difficult for me, I am very grateful for it and I feel accomplished now that I have completed it. I learned how to configure, design, and program a Raspberry Pi integrated with arduino based devices. I created an IoT system capable of monitoring and controlling a physical process with an analog measurement (temperature). I learned how to pseudocode, provide a detailed system analysis, and more importantly I understood thoroughly what each program does and how it works (Controller, historian, rules, app.py, etc.)

## What do I believe I need to improve?
I definitely need to improve my understanding of having a system start on the raspberry pi start up, since I couldn't figure it out in the end. I tried for a while and it ended up being too late for me to figure it out. Consequently, I need to improve my time management, which was a struggle throughout the entire project. It was very hard for me to manage my time with school, other classes, work, hockey, and the gym. I should've had my priorities more straight but I also feel like in the end everything worked out well (except for the system startup) and I am satisfied with my results.

## What the teacher could've done or said to make the learning easier:
I think the main thing the teacher could've done to make the learning easier is give us more time in class to work on the project. I get that he still had to explain us the programs and some theory, but for a project this big, having more time during class time would've been very helpful considering that it's harder to ask questions when we work on it at home. The other issue was that we had to turn in assignment 2 during the time we were working on the LIA, though assignment 2 was very helpful for the completion of the LIA, I felt a little bit overwhelmed with work. The last thing would be that he didn't really teach us how to start the system on boot, which would've clearly been helpful for me since I could not figure it out at home. Other than these minor issues, I feel like the project and the course were taught very well and I am satisfied with the overall results and what I have learned throughout the semester.

## What I could've done to make the learning easier:
I could've had better time management and made sure I showed up to class every week ready to ask questions. Instead, I wasn't as advanced as I would've liked as the semester progressed and I ended up having to do more work towards the last couple of weeks. I also should've checked the system start on boot before the end of the semester, so that I would've had the chance to ask the teacher questions regarding this. Instead, I tried to do everything at home last minute and I couldn't figure out how to make it work, which cost me points in the end.
