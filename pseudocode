System operation:


ESP32:

Setup:
On the breadboard:
DHT11 temperature sensor
Green LED
Yellow LED
Red LED
Fan
Buzzer

The DHT11 will be measuring the real-time temperature of the "machine"
It will be using mosquitto_pub to send a message to the IoT_Controller.py containing the value measured by the DHT11


JSON rules:

Rule 1:
IF the temperature is below 25 degrees celsius
THEN 
    It will print out "Right temperature, turn on green LED."
    Publish the message "Cool" to the topic machine/status.
Rule 2:
IF the temperature is between 25 degrees celsius and 30 degrees celsius
THEN
    It will print out "It's starting to get warm, turn on the fan and yellow LED."
    Publish the message "warm" to the topic machine/status. 
Rule 3:
IF the temperature is over 30 degrees celsius
THEN
    It will print out "It's too hot, turn on the buzzer and red LED."
    Publish the message "overheat" to the topic machine/status.



IoT_Controller.py:

Reads our JSON set of rules.
Connects to the MQTT message broker (ESP32).
Subscribes to all the topics on the broker.
Process incoming messages and compare the received data with the conditions defined in the rules. The data received will be the recorded temperature by the DHT11
It will compare the value from the ESP32 to the value we want.
According to the value from the ESP32, it will send a message back to the ESP32:



ESP32:
According to the message received, it will perform actions such as:
IF value < 25 --> GREEN LED
IF 25 > value < 30 --> YELLOW LED AND FAN
IF value > 30 --> RED LED AND BUZZER AND FAN
